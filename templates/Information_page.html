        <p>Why collecting data on students progress is useful</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Finding out where students are struggling:</strong> By analysing students grades, we can discover where students need help and potentially offer extra support in that subject.</li>
            <li><strong>Evaluating the colleges services:</strong> Student feedback can also help improve college services by helping discover what the college is doing wrong so it can be fixed.</li>
            <li><strong>Improving the students experience:</strong> By using the feedback to improve the college, we can ensure that the students experience will be better, showing why student feedback is important.</li>
            <li><strong>Ensuring classroom safety:</strong> Feedback is also useful for making sure classrooms are well-kept and nothing unacceptable is happening or if it is, it helps in removing these problems.</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- concluding why collecting data is important -->
        <p>Overall, collecting data on student progress is essential for improving academic results for students and keeping a safe classroom.</p>
